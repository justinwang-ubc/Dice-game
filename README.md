# Dice-game-
this project is about using the DOM and Javascript to create the dice game. 
.

 it's a paint with a title that says Refresh Me, and then it's got Player 1 dice and Player 2 dice.And when people refresh the web site then our dice get thrown randomly, so that player 1 and player 2

both have their own dice values, and the web site will announce a winner depending on whose dice value was higher.
